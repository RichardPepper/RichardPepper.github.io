<p>Innovation is altering the method we communicate with the people and items around us. When mobile data-capture gadgets were introduced, pest control specialists were able to record real-time data about the area and nature of pest issues and after that store it in a central database online that both facility managers and pest control professionals could access.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management suggests careful factor to consider of all available plant protection techniques and subsequent combination of suitable steps that discourage the development of populations of hazardous organisms and keep using plant defense items and other forms of intervention to levels that are economically and environmentally justified and lower or minimise risks to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a environmentally benign and economical  pest control method preferably matched for both small and large farmers around the globe. As soon as termites have entered a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be considered as a decision-making process in which observations (from examination and tracking) are used to make pest control decisions based upon pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>More details is required about food-chain concentration and useful ways of getting rid of damaging impacts of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have served their purpose.
