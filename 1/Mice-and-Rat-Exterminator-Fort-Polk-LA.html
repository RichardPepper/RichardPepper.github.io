The chemical controls are applied only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level.

Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last resort. Integrated pest management was conceived throughout the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget impacts, and financial waste were clearly apparent (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was hence associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used just after regular monitoring suggested that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the cost of the control steps.</p>
<p>Pests can damage specimen labels, padding, drawers and cabinets that are necessary for the appropriate care of geological collections. Industry leading treatment procedures - We integrate proven pest control processes with innovative innovations established in our world-renowned research laboratory to guarantee you constantly remain one step ahead of pest risks.
