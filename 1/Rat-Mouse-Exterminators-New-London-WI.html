<p>Innovation is changing the method we interact with individuals and items around us. When mobile data-capture devices were introduced, pest control professionals had the ability to capture real-time information about the place and nature of pest issues and then keep it in a main database online that both facility supervisors and pest control professionals could access.</p>
<p>Link to PRI's Pest Management Publications to learn more about low-impact methods of pest control that lessen pesticide usage and exposure. When you hire a pest control company, you are complimentary to invest that time doing other crucial things. In the last few years, pest control has ended up being more technically involved, with licencing and limitations on chemicals," Dr. Siddiqi states.</p>
