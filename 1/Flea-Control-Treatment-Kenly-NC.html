<p>The variety of pests found in food processing plants will vary according to food, location and environment components processed, but the most common ones are beetles, moths, rodents, cockroaches, and flies. Due to the fact that the biorationals are usually less toxic and more selective, they are typically less harmful to natural opponents and the environment.
