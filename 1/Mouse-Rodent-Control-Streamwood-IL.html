<p>If it was not commonly adopted, all countries acknowledged IPM as a desirable method to pest control even. Pests are a major danger that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a waste of time and resources. Biological insecticides, originated from naturally happening bacteria (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic fungis and entomopathogenic nematodes ), also fall in this category.</p>
<p>Our pest control termite service is safe for children, family pets, pregnant women and persons with allergic reaction. For example, pyrethrins are extremely hazardous to honey bees, fish, and water invertebrates (NPIC 2014 ).
