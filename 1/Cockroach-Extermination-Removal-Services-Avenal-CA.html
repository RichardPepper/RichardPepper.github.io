<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been successfully utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
