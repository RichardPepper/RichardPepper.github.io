<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control home pest pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically specifically about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>They carry out inspections to identify the issue and type of treatment required to eliminate the pests. A pesticide might be used only to plants that are listed on the label. In homes and metropolitan environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the environment with people, which eat and spoil possessions.

<p>The best way to control pests is to make your home unattractive to them. But home pests can likewise be a threat to your household. When searching for a place to infest, pests prefer to hide in a place that supplies food and a safe breeding place. Biological control is much easier to carry out in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>The behavior of the pest can be exploited for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and mating interruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When dispersed in the field or placed in traps, baits including poisonous product will attract and kill the pests. </p>
