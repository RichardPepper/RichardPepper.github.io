The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are frequently discovered pests in our society.</p>
