A normal pitfall most businesses encounter is describing their business name too literally by utilizing overused pest control terms like control, management, pesticide, and insecticide. The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are frequently discovered pests in our society.</p>
<p>When utilized effectively, nonchemical control alternatives delay, reduce, or eliminate the use of chemical pesticides.
