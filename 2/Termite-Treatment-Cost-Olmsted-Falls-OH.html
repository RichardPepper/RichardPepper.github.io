If many of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides ought to be utilized as the last resort, in concept, in some cases they are the first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of specific endemic or intrusive pests and diseases or to protect the seed and transplants from common and relentless pest issues.</p>
<p>More information is required about food-chain concentration and useful ways of getting rid of harmful results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have served their function. Don't base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests attack plants from everywhere: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy leaves and berries coming from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds assaulting from the air.</p>
