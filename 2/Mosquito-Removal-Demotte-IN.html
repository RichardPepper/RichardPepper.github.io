Practically every kind of pest poses a risk to the residential or commercial properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>This physical control puts an instant end to pests' plant-damaging days. Pesticides not included in baits or traps should normally only be applied to targeted places, not sprayed over the entire space.
