<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to safeguard the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active function in incorporated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
<p>The concept of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for managing pests, has remained in practice for a long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Freezer is likewise considered a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their advancement and more feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>The determination of the proper cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides toxic to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect types or life phases. </p>
<p>They believed that some attributes of area-wide management are incompatible with lots of traditional IRM methods, but suggested that use of biologically based control strategies, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, might contribute to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After carrying out any pest management tactic, examine the indicator plants to evaluate if arthropod pests have been eliminated and assess the efficiency and longevity of control.</p>
