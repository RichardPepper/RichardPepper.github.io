<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly achieve levels at which damage is caused therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a rich area likely will have a great deal of big, costly homes, so pest control expenses could be higher there due to the fact that there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
