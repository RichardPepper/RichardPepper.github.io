<p>If a pest or illness triggers undesirable damage despite preventative efforts, pick a reliable management approach that will have the least quantity of impact on other living animals and the environment. Examples consist of growing of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting sites, trap crops, and changing the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply chosen biopesticides with low environmental impact.
