<p>It is likewise obvious from many conversations with growers and pest control specialists in California that resistance management viewed as turning pesticides among various mode of action groups is typically viewed as IPM, although resistance management is just a part of IPM. Pest control is the policy or management of a species defined as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities.</p>
<p>In addition to developing clear indications that a pest control program is indeed an IPM system, it is also required to supply criteria to measure performance of the system. Generally between 30 minutes to 2 hours is needed to execute the general pest control treatment. Public demand is affected by retail marketing methods, issues for food safety based on pesticide guidelines in their area, and an absence of understanding on food production among other aspects.</p>
