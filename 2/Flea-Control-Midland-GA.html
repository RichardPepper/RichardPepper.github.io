Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus practitioners need to have -highlighting the wider ecology of pest management and avoiding toxic chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic condition, environmental and social consequences 13 and applies to the majority of agricultural, public health and feature pest management scenarios.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and takes into account a balanced mix of the abovementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful plan.</p>
