Trap crops: Some cotton pests choose crops like maize, sunflower, okra (girl finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a bigger community and manages both with the huge picture in mind.</p>
<p>They primarily use natural methods and pesticides that are evaluated and licensed and are secure for usage and do not possess any dangerous effects on the environment. This and other pathogens are effective biological pesticides for really specific pests. The size of the location and the kind of pest control approach consisting of the quantity of pest control chemicals chooses the final expense of the treatment.</p>
