Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
