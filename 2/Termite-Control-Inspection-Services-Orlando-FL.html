Increasing yields on the existing agricultural land base whilst protecting biodiversity and the environment has never been more vital as the worldwide population rises and demand for food and pressure on natural resources grows.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the principle of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later expanded to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
