Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt contaminants are planted in millions of hectares worldwide.

<p>In contrast, natural food production applies a lot of the exact same principles as IPM however limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
