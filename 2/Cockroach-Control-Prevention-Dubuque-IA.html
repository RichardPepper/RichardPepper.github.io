IPM techniques consist of the introduction of predators and specific parasitoids (types of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects). The generic term pesticides" can apply to a broad spectrum of chemicals, including insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and comparable chemicals.</p>
