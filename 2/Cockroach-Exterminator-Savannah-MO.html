<p>A comprehensive knowledge of basic IPM principles and various management options for all possible pest issues is very important as some are preventive and others are curative. We generally recommend pest control chemicals that finish the job using the least amount of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option). These avoidance and control tactics consist of biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, hereditary, chemical, and regulative approaches.</p>

Crucial documents include a scope of service, pest activity reports, service reports, restorative action reports, trap layout maps, lists of authorized pesticides, pesticide usage reports and applicator licenses.</p>
