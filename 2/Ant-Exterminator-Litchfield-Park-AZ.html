Along the continuum, extra non-chemical techniques such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop varieties, mating disturbance, sterile pest release, etc., may be integrated into the system.</p>
<p>The report talks about the value of pest control in addition to the threats of pesticide use. Alternatively, different approaches of biological control can be utilized including sterilisation programmes. Dependence on understanding, experience, observation and combination of several techniques makes IPM suitable for organic farming (omitting synthetic pesticides).</p>

For pest control, temperature must be 68 Â° F or lower, and relative humidity must be kept below an optimum of 70%; however, preserving climate conditions suggested for the preservation of books and paper will assist to control insect populations. For instance, feeding activities of particular caterpillars on the leaves of potatoes and tomatoes induce a systemic production of protease inhibitors expressed throughout the plant that hinder the food digestion process and feeding behavior of insects (36 ).</p>
