<p>Objective Statement: The mission of Mosquito Control is to offer Leon County citizens with efficient and environmentally sound mosquito control services. Much like us, pests require food, water, and shelter to endure, and if they can't discover these in your house, it's likely they'll go elsewhere. Pests can not endure without food and will not infest a building if they can not enter it. Another method involves utilizing baits that either damage the pests or avoid them from reproducing. C) Reduction in quantities of production and protection inputs of non-renewable resource origin (mainly pesticides) while preserving steady productivity levels for the area.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management methods, a practice referred to as incorporated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to weeds, illness, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the increase of pest control.</p>
