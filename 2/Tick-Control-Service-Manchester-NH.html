<p>WIRES comprehends the Google translation of our site might not be ideal. This approach describes using a range of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (in some cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of insects, mites, and spiders have established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the type of a strong, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests choose crops like maize, sunflower, okra (lady finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a bigger community and manages both with the big picture in mind.</p>
