<p>Objective Statement: The objective of Mosquito Control is to offer Leon County residents with effective and environmentally sound mosquito control services. Much like us, pests need water, food, and shelter to endure, and if they can't find these in your house, it's most likely they'll go in other places. Pests can not endure without food and will not infest a building if they can not enter it. Another technique includes using baits that either ruin the pests or prevent them from replicating. C) Decrease in amounts of production and protection inputs of non-renewable resource origin (generally pesticides) while maintaining steady productivity levels for the area.</p>
