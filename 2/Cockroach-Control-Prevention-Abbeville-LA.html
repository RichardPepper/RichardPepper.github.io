Given that 2003, most of new pesticide registrations have actually satisfied requirements set by EPA for decreased risk" consisting of lower threats to human health and non-target organisms, and decrease potential for contamination of groundwater, surface water, and other ecological resources.</p>
<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dose when other techniques of pest control have stopped working.
