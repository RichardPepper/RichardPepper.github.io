<h3>Why Pest Management Is Extremely Important Stafford Springs CT</h3>
<p>Pesticides are selected and used in such a way that reduces their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in reality requirement based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or packaging, and the center itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
<p>Socio-psychological aspects including reasonable and ethical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise showed that an absence of qualified IPM specialists and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM execution in developed nations.</p>
