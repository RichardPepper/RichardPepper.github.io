<p>Physical and mechanical controls kill a pest straight, block pests out, or make the environment unsuitable for it. Traps for rodents are examples of mechanical control.

<p>Therefore IPM is best mix of all possible methods in pest management with least dependence on chemical pesticide. Management choices need to be based upon tracking and population levels of insect pests, as well as dependable thresholds. IPM addresses all the financial, ecological, and social elements and provides safe and cost effective food to the earnings and consumers to producers and sellers, while keeping ecological health.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 types of termites, insects, and spiders have actually established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the type of a strong, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests choose crops like maize, sunflower, okra (lady finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a larger community and handles both with the huge picture in mind.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and takes into account a balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>More information is required about food-chain concentration and useful ways of removing harmful effects of pesticide residues that might stay in the environment after the pesticides have served their function. Don't base pest management programs on total removal of a pest. Pests attack plants from everywhere: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds assaulting from the air. </p>
