<p>Mission Declaration: The mission of Mosquito Control is to supply Leon County homeowners with effective and ecologically sound mosquito control services. Similar to us, pests need food, shelter, and water to endure, and if they can't find these in your house, it's likely they'll go somewhere else. Pests can not make it through without food and will not infest a building if they can not enter it. Another technique involves using baits that either destroy the pests or prevent them from replicating. C) Reduction in amounts of production and protection inputs of non-renewable resource origin (primarily pesticides) while preserving stable efficiency levels for the region.</p>

Efficient, irreversible corrective actions can then be required to avoid pests from getting in the structure and infesting the building and collections.</p>
