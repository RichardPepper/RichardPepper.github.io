<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and reduce risk from pests and pest management tools and techniques in such a way that decreases general financial, health, and ecological dangers.</p>
<p>It uses a combination of practices and control techniques with the objective of preventing problems from lowering the requirement and happening for pesticide extensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Also, consider policies and procedures that might unwittingly introduce pests: storage practices and devices, maintenance, and housekeeping practices. The term was later broadened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (13 ). Consequently, under the term IPM," numerous authors have promoted the principle of including the complete selection of pest management practices together with production objectives into a total systems technique.</p>
<p>Using details about pests' biology and habits, along with an arsenal of pest management techniques, pest control workers locate, recognize, and remove pests. But due to the fact that these "sex" traps attract primarily male insects, they aren't very reliable controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest. A regular tracking program is the basis of IPM decision making, no matter the control methods used.</p>
