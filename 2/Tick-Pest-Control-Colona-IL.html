A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides stemmed from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally happening materials.</p>
<p>There are numerous definitions that describe what Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is. Crucial is its aim: utilize biological control when you can, chemical control when you must.
