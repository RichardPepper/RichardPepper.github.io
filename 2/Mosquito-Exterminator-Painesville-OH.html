<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable technique that integrates practices for the financial avoidance and control of pests and illness in crops.  Special safety measures need to be required to keep pest control treatments from threatening food safety. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic technique to pest control.</p>
