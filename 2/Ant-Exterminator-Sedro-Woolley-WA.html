<p>Not sure how to get rid of cockroaches? Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control family insect pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly solely about minimizing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Pest control materials are chosen and applied in a manner that decreases threats to human health, useful and nontarget organisms, and the environment.
