<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests.

If all other integrated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control employees utilize a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as integrated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though contested by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the intensification of pest control.</p>

Business pest control clients that their storage centers and warehouses are efficiently treated.

<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down development and feeding and go through greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ).
