<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests.

If all other integrated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control employees utilize a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as integrated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though contested by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the intensification of pest control.</p>

Business pest control clients that their storage centers and warehouses are efficiently treated.

The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has actually been efficiently utilized versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down development and feeding and go through greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ).
